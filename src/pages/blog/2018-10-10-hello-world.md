**I am a full stack software engineer specialising in Amazon Web Services, PHP, NodeJS and DevOps. I have many years of industry experience building Web Applications and creating Hosting solutions for a wide range of clients.**

I have recently been promoted to Lead Developer at [JUMP](https://www.wesayhowhigh.com). From day to day you will find me assisting my team, delivering training, managing technical direction as well as developing code and infrastructure.
It is my role at JUMP to make myself and those around me better, to have and set clear objectives for the business and consistently deliver.

## Experience

* Infrastructure as code within Cloud Services, particularly AWS
* Small CMS websites
* Enterprise sized Web Applications
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
* Micro Services and Kubernetees
* High Traffic Websites

## Hobbies

When i'm not Programming I tend to be active, participating in sports; Boxing, Climbing and Running. You may also find me in BrewDog or drinking whatever beer is on offer at ASDA whilst watching Youtube/Netflix with the lads.

## Objectives

This year I would like to help JUMP progress as well as create a positive environment for the JUMP Team where they may thrive. Outside of JUMP I will be reaching out to members of the open source community and hope to make a positive contribution giving back 
to an ideology I owe my career to. I will be documenting my progress in this mini blog as well as collating my experience and knowledge as a developer.
